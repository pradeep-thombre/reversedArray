# reversedArray
 
## Task1 (Basics)

- Create a simple application that:
	has a function that takes an array (slice) as input, and returns a new array as output with the order reversed
	in the main function, call this function, and then print the output and input (first the output and then the input)

- Turn your application into a go module (using go mod init)
